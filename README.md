# Supported languages (planned)

Yes.

# What about this name?

estouComSort is a very silly pun in Portuguese. "Estou com sorte" means something like "I'm feeling lucky".

# Guidelines

- Each language has its own folder
- Initially not considering multiple versions of the same language
- estouComSort should be implemented as a library (or equivalent) and called in "main" program
- Should have tests
